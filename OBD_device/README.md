Abstract

Author  Jarkko Aho  
Title   Remote reading OBD-device  
Date    23 March 2018  

This innovation project was a customer research project for startup company that specializes in OBD-devices (On-Board Diagnostics). The aim of this project was to design a OBD-connected device that collects data from the vehicle and sends it to company’s server using cellular network.  
  
The project design was started according to the customer’s requirements. Parts of the project were selected based on their availability and ease of use. The purpose of the completed prototype was to find out the future problems of product development and the extent of product manufacturing.  
  
The wireframe was designed with C/C++ programming language to LPCXpresso 1549 -microprocessor and was programmed using the MCUXpresso IDE programming environment. Vehicle acceleration and location data was recorded with a separate acceleration and GPS modules and data was send to 3G cellular network with a separate GPRS/GSM module.  
  
The result was not tested on OBD-connection nor the data was sent to company’s server, due to an innovation project’s extent. The resulted prototype collected the acceleration and location data and could connect to the internet with 3G.
