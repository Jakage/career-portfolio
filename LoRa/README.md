Author - Jarkko Aho  
Title - LoRa modules in IoT  
Date - 2018  
Language - C/C++  
  
This LoRa-module/LoraWAN project is my Bachelor's thesis that I'm currently working on.  
  
This thesis started as a customer research project for startup company that specializes in home technology IoT (Internet of Things). The aim of this project was to design a LoRa-device that collects data from a home user and sends it to company’s server using LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), where the user can view the collected data.  
  
The project design was started according to the customer’s requirements. Parts of the project were selected based on their availability and ease of use. The purpose of the completed prototype was to find out the future problems of product development and the extent of product manufacturing.  
  
The wireframe was designed with C/C++ programming language to LPCXpresso 1549 -microprocessor and was programmed using the MCUXpresso IDE programming environment. Semtech SX1272 RF Transceiver was used as LoRa-module.  
  
The project and the thesis documentation are still work in progress.
