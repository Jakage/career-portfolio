#### Jarkko Aho - Online Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Jarkko Aho, and this is my online career portfolio. I'm a embedded systems engineering student from Helsinki Finland. I'm studying in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis about Long Range radio (LoRa) modules in IoT. I still have lot to learn about programming and embedded systems, but I learn new skills fast and I can easily understand new things through practice.  
  
In the code section you can find code examples of all the major projects I've done. Each folder has its own readme file with pictures and brief description of the project.  
Below you can find a plain text version of my CV in English, and you can find the formatted pdf CV in English and Finnish from the code section.

Skills  
  
Spoken languages: My native language is Finnish but I speak fluent English, which is the main study/work language in university. I also understand little Swedish and Japanese.  
  
Programming languages: My main programming language in university is C/C++, but I've worked a lot with C#, Java and Python.  
  
Tools: I learned programming and debugging on multiple platforms including Windows and Linux, using IDEs such as Visual Studio, Eclipse and MCUXpresso.  
I'm used to work with different ARM Cortex-M microprocessors such as NXP LPC1549 and Cypress, and I've made a few simple projects with Arduino UNO.  
I've worked with various kind of sensors from simple thermistors to more complex LoRa radio modules.  
I'm also familiar with graphic designing programs like Adobe Illustrator CS6 and Adobe Photoshop CS6.  
  
Teamwork and Leadership: I participated in many group projects throughout my time at university, both as a leader and team member. I get along well with all kinds of people. I've not met yet a person whom I would have had problems working with.  
  
Experience - ICT  
  
6/2017 – 8/2017 - Game Programmer Intern - Ticca Oy  
As an intern in Ticca I worked on a Virtual Reality (VR) puzzle game that was made on Epic Games Unreal 4 game engine. I was responsible for programming interactive mechanisms, like elevators, buttons and locks. Most of the programming was made using the Unreal 4 game engine's Blueprint visual scripting language, but some parts still required Visual Studio and C++.
