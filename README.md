#### Jarkko Aho - Online Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Jarkko Aho, and this is my online career portfolio. I'm a embedded systems engineering student from Helsinki Finland. I'm studying in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis about Long Range radio (LoRa) modules in IoT.  
  
In the code section and below you can find all the major projects I've done. Each folder has its own readme file with pictures and brief description of the project. You can also find my CV in English and Finnish in the code section, and more information from text based CV in English.

| Project  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![](https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/blob/master/LoRa/Pictures/LoRa_prototype_v05.jpg)  | This thesis started as a customer research project for startup company that specializes in home technology IoT (Internet of Things). The aim of this project was to design a LoRa-device that collects data from a home user and sends it to company’s server using LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), where the user can view the collected data. The wireframe was designed with C/C++ programming language to LPCXpresso 1549 -microprocessor and was programmed using the MCUXpresso IDE programming environment. Semtech SX1272 RF Transceiver was used as LoRa-module. The project and the thesis documentation are still work in progress. https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/tree/master/LoRa   |
| ![](https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/blob/master/OBD_device/Pictures/Circuit_diagram_Innovationproject_prototype.png)  | This innovation project was a customer research project for startup company that specializes in OBD-devices (On-Board Diagnostics). The aim of this project was to design a OBD-connected device that collects data from the vehicle and sends it to company’s server using cellular network. The wireframe was designed with C/C++ programming language to LPCXpresso 1549 -microprocessor and was programmed using the MCUXpresso IDE programming environment. Vehicle acceleration and location data was recorded with a separate acceleration and GPS modules and data was send to 3G cellular network with a separate GPRS/GSM module. https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/tree/master/OBD_device  |
| ![](https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/blob/master/XY_Plotter/docs/xyplotter.jpg)  | This course project was a part of a Embedded Systems project course. The project was a team work, and the team consist of two students. The team’s goal was to create the firmware for Makeblock XY-Plotter drawing robot using LPCXpresso 1549 -microcontroller and MCUXpresso IDE programming environment. Makeblock's mDraw program was used to send the G-codes to the microprocessor. https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/tree/master/XY_Plotter  |
