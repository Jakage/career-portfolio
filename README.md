#### Jarkko Aho - Online Portfolio - WORK IN PROGRESS

Welcome! I'm Jarkko Aho, and this is my online career portfolio. I'm a embedded systems engineering student from Helsinki Finland. I'm studying in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis about Long Range radio (LoRa) modules in IoT. I still have lot to learn about programming and embedded systems, but I learn new skills fast and I can easily understand new things through practice.  
  
In the code section you can find code examples of all the major projects I've done. Each folder has its own readme file with pictures and brief description of the project.  
Below you can find a plain text version of my CV in English, and you can find the formatted pdf CV in English and Finnish from the code section.

| ![](https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/blob/master/OBD_device/Pictures/Circuit_diagram_Innovationproject_prototype.png)  | This innovation project was a customer research project for startup company that specializes in OBD-devices (On-Board Diagnostics). The aim of this project was to design a OBD-connected device that collects data from the vehicle and sends it to company’s server using cellular network. The wireframe was designed with C/C++ programming language to LPCXpresso 1549 -microprocessor and was programmed using the MCUXpresso IDE programming environment. Vehicle acceleration and location data was recorded with a separate acceleration and GPS modules and data was send to 3G cellular network with a separate GPRS/GSM module. https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/tree/master/OBD_device  |

The project was a team work, and the team consist of two students. The team’s goal was to create the firmware for Makeblock XY-Plotter drawing robot using LPCXpresso 1549 -microcontroller and MCUXpresso IDE programming environment. Makeblock's mDraw program was used to send the G-codes to the microprocessor. https://github.com/Jakage/career-portfolio/tree/master/XY_Plotter  |
